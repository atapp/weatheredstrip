# Weathered-Strip
## Intro
Weathered Strip was created to help gather all required flight planning documentation in one place. It provides NOTAMs, METARs/TAFs and live RVR for each requested airport.

## Demo
This is a live application which can be accessed at the following link: [Weathered Strip](https://www.greghamel.com/weatheredstrip)

## Limitations
The app and server currently have a few limitations:
 1. Only canadian airports are currently supported;
 1. The server will not respond if an invalid request is made (an invalid airport ICAO name is provided)
